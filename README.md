This project uses ensemble learning techniques to predict loan ratings (from A to E) based on applicant data. 

Three methods - Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and AdaBoost - are compared for their predictive performance.

We compare three ensemble learning methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and AdaBoost.
