Risk management and increasing profitability are central goals in the financial world and in the management of lending institutions in particular.
The processes of making business decisions are based on a careful analysis of the expected risks and profits.
This project focuses on data mining techniques for predicting loan ratings, with the aim of classifying applicants into categories from A (excellent credit history) to E (high risk profile).
In our project, we will compare the prediction results of three ensemble learning methods -
• Random Forest
• Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
• AdaBoost
