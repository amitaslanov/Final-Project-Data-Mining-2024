This project focuses on using data mining techniques to predict loan ratings, categorizing applicants from A (excellent credit) to E (high risk).
We compare three ensemble learning methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and AdaBoost. 
Additionally, a GUI interface is available in the "GUI_LoanGradePrediction" Jupyter notebook for user-friendly interaction.
